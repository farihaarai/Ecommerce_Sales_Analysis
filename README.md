# ECOMMERCE SALES ANALYSIS
## Objective:
This project explores Targetâ€™s e-commerce operations in Brazil, analyzing a dataset of 10,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer behavior, order fulfillment, product performance, and seller distribution. By integrating Python for data processing and MySQL for structured queries, the analysis provides actionable insights to enhance logistics, optimize pricing, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Features of the Project:
### 1. Data Processing & SQL Integration:
- Database Setup: MySQL used to store, query, and retrieve structured data efficiently.
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, standardizing timestamps, and structuring datasets.
- SQL Queries: Extracting order trends, payment patterns, and seller performance.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Order Trends: Analysis of order statuses (delivered, canceled, shipped, etc.).
- Shipping Performance: Estimated vs. actual delivery times, carrier delays.
- Product & Pricing Analysis: Identifying best-selling categories and pricing strategies.
- Customer Behavior: Regional demand distribution, purchase frequency, and payment methods.
### 3. Data Visualization:
- Geospatial Analysis: Mapping customer and seller locations across Brazil.
- Time-Series Trends: Order volumes, seasonal variations, and fulfillment performance.
- Correlation Analysis: Relationship between pricing, shipping time, and customer location.
### 4. Key Insights & Business Recommendations:
- Optimizing logistics based on shipping delays and regional demand.
- Improving product categorization and pricing strategies.
- Enhancing customer experience through better fulfillment and payment options.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data processing & visualization.
- MySQL: Structured data storage, querying, and relational analysis.
- Data Handling: Pandas for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
